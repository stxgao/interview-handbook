# Web Storage

Web storage refers to a set of mechanisms that web browsers provide for storing data on the client side (i.e., on the user's device). There are two main types of web storage: local storage and session storage.

## Local Storage

- **Purpose:** Local storage allows you to store data with no expiration date. This means that the data will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- **Scope:** The data stored in local storage is available across browser sessions and tabs, and it remains on the user's device until explicitly cleared either by the user or the web application.
- **Usage:** You can use the `localStorage` object in JavaScript to store and retrieve data.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   // Store data in local storage
   localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

   // Retrieve data from local storage
   var storedValue = localStorage.getItem('key');

## Session Storage

- **Purpose:** Session storage, as the name implies, is designed to store data for the duration of a page session. The data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
- **Scope:** The data stored in session storage is limited to the current session. If the user closes the tab or window, the data is lost.
- **Usage:** Similar to local storage, you can use the `sessionStorage` object in JavaScript to store and retrieve data.

   Example usage:
   ```javascript
   // Store data in session storage
   sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

   // Retrieve data from session storage
   var storedValue = sessionStorage.getItem('key');


## Storage Objects Methods and Properties

Both storage objects provide the same methods and properties:

- `setItem(key, value)` – store key/value pair.
- `getItem(key)` – get the value by key.
- `removeItem(key)` – remove the key with its value.
- `clear()` – delete everything.
- `key(index)` – get the key at a given position.
- `length` – the number of stored items.

As you can see, it’s like a Map collection (`setItem`/`getItem`/`removeItem`), but also allows access by index with `key(index)`.



## Web Storage vs Cookies

We already have cookies. Why additional objects?

Unlike cookies, web storage objects are not sent to the server with each request. Because of that, we can store much more. Most modern browsers allow at least 5 megabytes of data (or more) and have settings to configure that.

Also, unlike cookies, the server can't manipulate storage objects via HTTP headers. Everything's done in JavaScript.

The storage is bound to the origin (same-origin policy). That is, different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects; they can't access data from each other.


## Mock Interview Questions

### Web Storage Basics

**Can you explain what web storage is and why it's used in web development?**
- *Answer:* Web storage is a client-side storage solution provided by web browsers. It allows web developers to store data on the user's device, reducing the need for frequent server requests. Web storage is commonly used to store key-value pairs and is more secure than traditional cookies.

**What are the key differences between local storage and session storage? When would you use one over the other?**
- *Answer:* Local storage persists data without an expiration date, while session storage lasts only for the duration of a page session. I would use local storage for data that needs to persist across sessions, like user preferences, and session storage for temporary data that is only relevant during a specific user session, such as progress in a multi-step form.

### Technical Implementation

**How do you use local storage in JavaScript to store, retrieve, and delete data? Can you provide an example?**
- *Answer:* 
   ```javascript
   // Storing data in local storage
   localStorage.setItem('username', 'stxgao');

   // Retrieving data from local storage
   var storedValue = localStorage.getItem('username');

   // Deleting data from local storage
   localStorage.removeItem('username');

### Real-world Scenarios

**Can you provide a real-world example or use case where web storage would be beneficial for improving user experience?**
- *Answer:* Web storage can enhance user experience by storing preferences, login tokens, or cached data, reducing the need for repeated server requests.

### Cross-browser Compatibility

**Why is it important to consider cross-browser compatibility when working with web storage, and how can you ensure your code works consistently across different browsers?**
- *Answer:* Different browsers may have varying storage limits or implementations. Testing and ensuring compatibility with major browsers is crucial. Libraries like Modernizr can help detect browser features.

### Best Practices:

**What are some best practices to follow when using web storage to ensure efficient and secure storage of data?**
- *Answer:*
  - Avoid storing sensitive information.
  - Use HTTPS to encrypt data during transfer.
  - Implement data validation to prevent malicious input.

**Q11: How would you handle the case where a user's browser does not support web storage?**
- *Answer:* Check for web storage support using feature detection (e.g., `if (typeof Storage !== 'undefined')`) and provide fallback mechanisms or notify the user.

### Advanced Concepts

**How would you implement data expiration or automatic cleanup in web storage?**
- *Answer:* Implement a timestamp with each stored item and periodically check and remove items that have expired.
